Apply This Line After After running the Run1. Aftre running the program you can see the whole we write on ifmain.py it will show here. 
But you ask for only addition so why it is given all output of previous file. So, If you don't want to see the extra 
information , there is  a function in python which is      if__name__=='__main__':  . 
After using this function, suppose you create an file  and you want to import  any file and after importing
 the file whatever function or anything you want, without printingextra information ,
  so you can use this if function in your previous file or any file , if you want to import the file 
in future
