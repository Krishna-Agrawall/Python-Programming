Polymorphism defines the ability to take different forms.
Polymorphism in Python allows us to define methods in the child class with the same name
as defined in their parent class.



for example :
    print(5+6) . It will give you 11 
    print('5'+'6'). It will return the 56 because of string. 

So, This is the polymorphism. one thing but in a different form. 

Another example:

You might know the tony stark from iron man. So, tony stark also and iron man also both are same but 
in a different form.

Peter-Parker and Spiderman . Again Both are same , but both had different type of forms. So, Whole 
This is known as Polymorphism. One Thing has different forms or roles in object-oriented-programming.

Abstraction+Enheritance:

Abstraction is hiding the details and implementation of the code.
Encapsulation is hiding the data and controlling the visibility of the code.

Well, There are 4 main concepts in object-oriented-programming

1.Abstraction
2.Encapsulation
3.Inheritance
4.Polymorphism
